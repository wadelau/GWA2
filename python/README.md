# GWA2 in Python

General Web Application Architecture (GWA2) is now working on the process of porting to Python, which helps developers make web applications in Python scripts.

The porting-to-python work initialized in 2018 and resumed to first draft in 2022.


## Python 3.0+ recommended

Upgrade Python from 2.x to 3.x before installation of GWA2 in Python.

## Python mysql.connector needed

As a web-based application with database-drived, MySQL as a backend data service is recommended.
